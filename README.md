## How To Clone
Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) to setup an ssh key because github no longer allows username, password authentication.

## Things you should install depending on what project you are working on
* VsCode - Just good to have
* Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition, make sure you add the .NET Core Web Development package - For C# API
* NodeJs - For Frontend
* Golang & Docker - For the High Performance API
